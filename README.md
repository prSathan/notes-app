## Note Tracker App

### Setup:
```
npm install
```

### Start app:
```
npm run start
```

### Unit test:
```
npm run test
```

### e2e/feature test:
```
npm run selenium-setup   //
npm run selenium-start   // app must also be started with npm start
npm run e2e-tests
```


### If I had more time:
```
I have a problem where I am trying to map over the noteItems array and cannot figure out why I am getting the error 
TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined, if I had more time I would be able to tinker around more and fix the problem.
DRY out my code as I feel there are quite a few places that could be refactored into a cleaner solution. 
Add some styling to make it aesthetic and an enjoyable user experience.
Add in the functionality to allow a user to delete a note and perhaps organise/filter their notes.
```
